## General Information
### Project Information
This project uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan should be defaulted or not.

### Project Background
Lending Club company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower-interest-rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labeled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

### Project statement
Find the driving factors that lead to the defaulted loans which are credit loss for the company.

### Data set
The dataset used here is a loan (CSV file) data set that has previous loan applicant information for Lending Club company.
